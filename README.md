🛡️ Phishing Email Analysis Report
  This project demonstrates the step-by-step analysis of a phishing email to identify common indicators of phishing attacks. The goal was to dissect and understand how attackers 
  use social engineering, spoofing, and deceptive tactics to trick users.

🔍 Tasks Performed

  Collected a sample phishing email from online

  Identified spoofed sender address attempting to mimic a trusted organization

  Analyzed full email headers using "EML Analyzer" to detect discrepancies and relay information mismatch

  Examined embedded URLs and found mismatched domains redirecting to suspicious login pages

  Detected urgent, threatening language aimed at creating panic (e.g., “Immediate action required”)

  Noted grammatical errors and poor formatting typical of phishing campaigns

  Highlighted the use of malicious-looking attachments and shortened links


✅ Summary of Findings

  The email contained several red flags, including a spoofed sender address, inconsistent header data, mismatched and masked URLs, urgent call-to-action language, 
  and multiple grammar issues. These findings clearly classify the email as a phishing attempt. The analysis demonstrates practical skills in email header investigation, link verification,
  and phishing detection techniques.
